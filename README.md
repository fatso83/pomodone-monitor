# pomodone-monitor
Monitor Pomodone changes using Zapier RSS feeds

## This personal project is using harcoded urls
This is a personal project that I just open-source to help others.
I haven't added a proper cli to make it configurable, nor have I documented
the data format for my RSS feed. You can just inspect it 
manually to see how it looks and duplicate it.

Feel free to drop me a note here or on Twitter (@kopseng)
